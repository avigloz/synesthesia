Synesthesia creates complex visual representations of audio.

## Plan

There are *three main components* to this project:

- Decoder :large_blue_circle:
- Interface between decoder and visualizer :red_circle:
- Visualizer :red_circle:

## Decoder 

Currently, the decoder is/will be designed to support the following audio file formats:

- `.flac`

Support for `.mp3, .mp4, .m4a, & .3gp` will most likely be added in the future. As of right now, to use other audio file formats, simply convert them to `.flac`.

## Visualizer

The visualizer is/will be designed to generate images (and potentially video in future), which is unique to individual audio inputs.

The nature of the algorithm is mostly currently unknown; I am thinking about that.

Current possibilities include:

- Fractals (which is likely sthe most promising)
- Lines of varying colors, intensity, etc.
- Shapes
- Collage
- etc.

Visuals will be dependant upon certain aspects of the music, such as pitch, bass tones, rhythm, etc.
